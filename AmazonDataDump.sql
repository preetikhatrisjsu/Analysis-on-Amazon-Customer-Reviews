You can rock out louder, with less sound to the sides & back, so you do not share your music to all, as does the Echo.2- The 8) Far Field microphones are more effective than Echo. 3- High resolution 7\" screen is perfect for a desk or kitchen. 4- Song lyrics are great!

While certainly not a deal breaker it was fun to watch. Setup was pretty straight forward and easy. It is a good aspect that we can talk to the device and it knows what we want to a certain extent. It is very literal at times and you have to make sure you have the exact code words or you get something other than what you want. (such as \"play\" or \"start\" or \"open\") I use it as an alarm clock and it is quite easy to set up the same time for my week but it would be a little more difficult if you have to work one weekend day of the week and then 4 more or other combination.

Yes, you can talk to it, and get results for almost any query, but with the show, you get a lot more. The touch screen is great for video calls, especially when you install the Alexa App on your family cell phones. Alexa can scan items via UPC and order them on Amazon, or tell you where to get them. The recipes you ask for are not only spoken to you, but SHOWN to you. Also, when music plays, you can see the lyrics on screen (If you use Amazon Music to play the music). You can ask for a news briefing, and you SEE the news, highlights, etc. The speakers aren\'t quite up to the same standard as the echo series, but it\'s close. The sound fills the room nicely.

It understands my voice really well, were most telephone automated assistants rarely get what I am saying. It want pair to my Portable Bluetooth Speaker. It will pair to my cell phone, but only to receive Music from it.The Audio quality is varies with amplitude. With low amplitudes Alexa has booming sound making it hard to understand from across the room, but an amplitude setting of about 50% the audio becomes clear and understandable.

Alexa works well with smart home devices such as light bulbs, outlets and thermostat. (Most of these are really easy to set up, so you don\'t have to be a very technical person.) All of which can be voice controlled or remotely via the Alexa app from your smart phone. If you have a friend with an Echo Show, you can make video calls via the devices or directly to a smart phone which is pretty awesome for family and friends whom live far away. As far as answering questions, do not expect the best answers. The Bing search engine needs some work.

It\'s also awesome to be able to display our security camera feed for the outdoor cameras, but you should probably investigate it\'s features and your needs before splurging on this over one of the more \'traditional\' echo devices.

The touch screen is great for video calls, especially when you install the Alexa App on your family cell phones. Alexa can scan items via UPC and order them on Amazon, or tell you where to get them. The recipes you ask for are not only spoken to you, but SHOWN to you. Also, when music plays, you can see the lyrics on screen (If you use Amazon Music to play the music). You can ask for a news briefing, and you SEE the news, highlights, etc. The speakers aren\'t quite up to the same standard as the echo series, but it\'s close. The sound fills the room nicely.
